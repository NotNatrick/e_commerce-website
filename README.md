# Ecommerce Web App

This is an ecommerce web application developed using PHP and MySQL, with Bootstrap for the user interface. The application allows visitors to browse products, view individual product descriptions, leave feedback in the comment section, and view seller information. Sellers need to register and await admin confirmation before they can start posting their products for sale. Each product requires admin approval before it is displayed to buyers. The admin has their own interface to manage seller accounts, products, comments, and other aspects of the application.
